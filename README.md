# myjquerryapp
I have finished working on my javascript. The app is fully functional, although not yet on web server. The app displays activities that are done, that have been submitted, and that were started and not yet  finished. the app does allow users to edit, add, and delete using titles. I made it easy by displaying all the titles that have been saved.
specifically: i worked harder on the edit page. It allows people to change the status of a task, or change it altogether.
What is left for me to do is to work the aesthetic side of the app and make it more user-friendly by making users type less. And Finally, i will to put it on a web server and push it to azure.
As for a grade, i would ideally love a 10 because the app does work as intended. However since i don't know where i am at compared to my peers, any positive grade would work for me.
